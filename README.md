# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to summarize the ride, driver, and fare data for the three types of cities being examined (Rural, Urban, and Suburban). Additionally, a visualization of the data is provided.

## Results

According to the results, Urban cities had the most total rides (1,625), total drivers (2,405), and total fares ($39,854.38). However, the Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and average fare per driver ($55.49). Suburban cities remained in the middle of all categories.<br><br>

All city types seem to see a spike in fares at the end of February. Urban city fares are up and down between March and April, while fares in Suburban and Urban cities are relatively flat during the same time period. In April, Suburban city fares seem to trend upward significantly, while Rural city fares peak at the beginning of the month and then decrease.

## Summary
This data should be used to adjust resources to meet demand, depending on time of year and the type of city where the rides take place. For one, to increase revenue, some drivers from Urban areas could be diverted to Rural areas given that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are significantly higher in Rural areas. This is likely because Rural areas are far more spread out and the distance between destinations is likely greater. Furthermore, the total number of drivers in Urban areas far outweighs the total number of rides, whereas in Rural areas the opposite is true. This again indicates that diverting drivers from Urban cities to Rural cities, especially from the end of February until the middle of April, would be more cost efficient and revenue producing. Lastly, around a week into the month of April, demand for rides is significantly higher in Suburban cities, while it is much lower in Rural cities and somewhat lower in Urban cities. Drivers from the latter two areas could be diverted to Suburban areas to meet this increased demand.
